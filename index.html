      <h1>MY FIRST WEBSITE!</h1>
        <p>by Irvinn Sanchez     (03-18-23)</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Welcome to my <strong>first</strong> ever Website.</h2>
        <p>This website is just for practise but I find great joy in making it, so I'm kind of bragging about it.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name is Irvinn Sanchez. Coding Isn't the first extremely complicated thing I've gotten into. Latin is, the langauage
           of the ancient Romans,<br> I take classes at my school and I love it very much. I guess I have a thing for overly
           complex de-coding type of processes. I'm currently<br>working towards a welding certificate along-side a phlybotomy
           certificate. I know what you're thinking, "Whoa those are very different fields",<br> and you'd be right. I actually
           began welding first and that was my only plan for a while. Then I was inspired by someone to also try phlybotomy.<br>
           So then welding became my plan-B and phlybotomy became my plan-A. But even so, I'm not exactly in love with either
           of those two, and I thought<br> I'd just have to suck it up cuz I meaan, although they arent the bomb, they do pay well.
           Until recently I realized how fun coding can be, and now I think<br> I want to focus on this. Ofcourse I'm still going
           to get my certificates and work on them. But I'm really hoping to get good enough at coding that I can start<br> working
           in this field, while also having two other route I can take if this doesnt work out.
        </p>

      <h3>What do I hope to do?</h3>
        <p> well at first, I wanted to work on a game using unity. Sadly my computer isn't really built for that. It never let
            into my projects therefore I could never use them.<br> I've found out of another game building proggram though unreal engine.
            I will attempt to use it soon and see what happens. I hope so much that It'l work because<br> otherwise my plan is to work
            on my coding until I can work for money. Then use that money to get a more advanced computer able to run whatever I need
            it to run.<br> In the meanwhile though, I'll begin making the world and story on paper, you know, brainstorm.
        </p>

    <div>
      <h3>Other things I hope to do with coding include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Make my own website for many things. That could be a personal website to direct whoever may want to know more
              about my work or somewhere I upload my art.</li>
          <li>Make a webside for a more important reason. I plan to one day make an actual website for an actual purpose.
              whatever that purpose may be, who knows.</li>
          <li>Make websites just to troll my friends hehe. With this power comes great responsibility, and I'm very irresponsible.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Message for my peeps :)</h3>
        <p>Hey, who ever is reading this. If you're reading this around the same time I'm writing this you know life's about to
          get all weird and different. I wish you the most amount of luck,<br> and that even if we never speak again, you recieve a beautiful
          and grand future.<br>We're still young. I know 30 years down the line we'll be thinking back to these days like "oh man, those
          days were fun". But even then I'm sure we're gonna be having plenty of fun<br> no matter how hard life gets. I'll make sure life
          isn't a bog for me, and I urge you to do the same for yourself.<br>Dont stress too much about the future. Just focus
          on what you can do today. Because today determines the future.<br><br>
          
          I have this to say about my future: I will enjoy a future having dipped my toes into a diverse set of occupations. I will attempt to open the bakery/cafe of my dreams, pistrinum qui
          somniavimus;<br> I will create games that many people will love and enjoy; I will spend some time as a phlebotomist in order to earn some
          dinero; If not as a phlebotomist then I will try being a welder; those two<br> will be my back-ups for dineros; I will be financially stable and
          earn a house and be comfortable enough to buy myself and others personal wants. I wont have to depend on anyone to sustain me<Br> and
          will instead be dependable both financially and emeotionally. People will respect me for me.<br><br>

          With this I leave this era, and start a new one. I loved sharing it with ya'll and will love seeing you in the next one. goodbye my friends. Vos Amo.
